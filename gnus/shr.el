;;; Commentary:

;; This package takes a HTML parse tree (as provided by
;; libxml-parse-html-region) and renders it in the current buffer.  It
;; does not do CSS, JavaScript or anything advanced: It's geared
;; towards rendering typical short snippets of HTML, like what you'd
;; find in HTML email and the like.
